# Angular View Encapsulation & CSS Specificity

This is a demo project created during an Insiten lunch & learn in order to answer the following questions:

- Does does Angular's View Encapsulation work?
- Under what circumstances might it be preferable to disable View Encapsulation?
- How does View Encapsulation interact with CSS specificity?
- What difference does it make whether we use the component's host element or put all operative elements in the component's template?
